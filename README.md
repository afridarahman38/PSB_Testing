# PSB_Testing
The **Palli Sanchay Bank(PSB)** Testing Project ensures the reliability, security, and performance of a banking application through rigorous software quality assurance. The project includes manual testing, database validation, performance and security assessments, and regression testing. Key deliverables include detailed test plans, test cases, checklists, and TDD framework implementations. By retesting and verifying exit criteria, the project ensures a seamless and robust user experience for banking operations.

## Key Features Tested
**1. Manual Testing**
- Verified the applicationâ€™s functionality by executing test cases for core banking features such as account creation, deposits, withdrawals, and loan processing.
- Conducted exploratory testing to uncover defects not covered by test cases.

**2. Database Testing**
- Validated database schema and integrity.
- Tested data retrieval, insertion, and updates to ensure consistent and accurate data flow between the application and the database.

**3. Performance Testing**
- Measured application performance under normal and peak loads.
- Identified bottlenecks and optimized response times for critical transactions.

**4. Security Testing**
- Conducted vulnerability assessments to protect against SQL injection, unauthorized access, and other security threats.
- Verified secure data transmission using encryption and secure protocols.

**5. Regression Testing**
- Ensured new updates or features did not disrupt existing functionalities.
- Automated repetitive regression tests to improve efficiency and coverage.

## Responsibilities
**Developed and Executed Test Plans and Cases**
- Designed comprehensive test plans, test cases, and checklists tailored to banking workflows.
- Covered functional, integration, and system testing scenarios.

**TDD Framework**
- Applied a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach to enhance code quality and maintainability.

**Retesting and Exit Criteria**
- Performed retesting to validate defect resolutions.
- Ensured all exit criteria were met before the release of the application.

## Tools and Technologies Used
**Testing Tools:** JIRA, TestRail, and Selenium for defect management, test case execution, and automated regression testing.

**Database Tools:** SQL for database queries and validation.

**Performance Tools:** Apache JMeter for load and performance testing.

**Security Tools:** OWASP ZAP for vulnerability assessments.

## Project Artifacts
**Test Plan:** Document outlining the scope, objectives, testing types, and schedule.

**Test Cases:** Detailed step-by-step instructions for executing tests and validating expected outcomes.

**Checklists:** Itemized testing checkpoints to ensure coverage of all critical areas.

**Reports:** Detailed test summary reports, defect reports, performance analysis, and security assessment findings.
